# PJensen

I’m a software architect at Harvard Management Company, where I design and build systems that bridge human insight with machine intelligence. My background blends technical depth with creative exploration, and I tend to approach complex problems from both angles — structure and imagination.

My fascination with computers started early, sparked by a summer at an MIT tech camp and deepened through years of hands-on projects that carried me into software engineering at Acadia University. Since then, my work has evolved from building tools to shaping platforms that support collaboration and clarity at scale.

I care deeply about craftsmanship, clarity, and empathy in software — not just how things work, but how they feel to use and maintain. I believe good systems should make their users feel capable, not constrained.

Outside of work, I’m drawn to the tactile: skiing, painting, sculpting, drumming, and gardening. Each one reminds me that creativity and precision don’t oppose each other — they refine each other.

🔭 I’m currently working on:

- JS-Hack, a zero-dependency, browser-native roguelike engine built around a custom ECS architecture.
