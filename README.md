# PJensen

I’m a software architect at Harvard Management Company, where I design and build systems that bridge human insight with machine intelligence. My background blends technical depth with creative exploration, and I tend to approach complex problems from both angles — structure and imagination.

My fascination with computers started early, sparked by a summer at an MIT tech camp and deepened through years of hands-on projects that carried me into software engineering at Acadia University. Since then, my work has evolved from building tools to shaping platforms that support collaboration and clarity at scale.

I care deeply about craftsmanship, clarity, and empathy in software — not just how things work, but how they feel to use and maintain. I believe good systems should make their users feel capable, not constrained.

Outside of work, I’m drawn to the tactile: skiing, painting, sculpting, drumming, and gardening. Each one reminds me that creativity and precision don’t oppose each other — they refine each other.

🔭 I’m currently working on:

ecs-js
A tiny, deterministic Entity–Component–System written in pure JavaScript.

Drop a script tag or import the module and you get:

- Deterministic World with seeded RNG and no framework lock-in.
- Phase-agnostic systems + `composeScheduler()` so you define your own pipeline.
- Snapshot/restore helpers for time travel, replays, and “what if?” scenarios.
- Archetypes/prefabs for building entities from reusable recipes.
- Optional extras: hierarchy, scripting, cross-world refs, raf loops.

Use it for:
- simulations (economies, fisheries, epidemics, factories)
- complex UIs with lots of interacting pieces
- games, of course – but it’s not *just* a game engine core.
