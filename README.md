# PJensen

I'm a software architect currently working with Harvard Management Company. My background combines technical knowledge with creativity, allowing me to contribute to diverse software solutions.

I discovered my interest in computers in grade school, an interest that was nurtured at an MIT summer camp. My path led me to a high school internship and eventually to studying software engineering at Canada's Acadia University.

I enjoy problem-solving and approach software development with an empathetic mindset, focusing on user needs. I value teamwork, communication, and ethical software development.

Outside work, my hobbies include skiing, painting, sculpting, drumming, and gardening. Each enriches my life and, in their own way, my work too.
